Ska5280 has changed hosting again! We've proven that Jekyll website is working really well for us, and that we can keep this website really simple.

This means that we can now give access to anyone with a [github](http://github.com) account in order to help us keep shows up to date.

The other bit advantage of using [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) is that it is complete free! So we can save money for more shows!

We are still looking for help with the site, so if you want to help post shows, learn more about jekyll, or have some awesome photos from shows, [contact us!](mailto:shows@ska5280.com).
