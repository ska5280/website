Less Than Jake played an awesome set at the Summit Music Hall here in Denver on March 9, 2012.&nbsp; It pulled mostly from <strike>[Pezcore](/web/20130701194644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pezcore)</strike> [Losing Streak](/web/20130701194644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Streak) (7 songs!), which is a great treat for old(er) LTJ fans.&nbsp; They opened with Gainesville Rock City from [Borders and Boundaries](/web/20130701194644/http://www.twistandshout.com/searchdetail.cfm?categoryID=46&amp;upc=751097061626), and 3 songs from both [Anthem](/web/20130701194644/http://www.twistandshout.com/searchdetail.cfm?categoryID=46&amp;upc=093624845928) and [Hello Rockview](/web/20130701194644/http://www.twistandshout.com/searchdetail.cfm?categoryID=46&amp;upc=724385766329).

There were two songss from the [TV/EP](/web/20130701194644/http://www.twistandshout.com/searchdetail.cfm?categoryID=46&amp;upc=020286154990) (it looks like Twist &amp; Shout may have a [vinyl version](/web/20130701194644/http://www.twistandshout.com/searchdetail.cfm?categoryID=46&amp;upc=020286155621) in stock!) which was an exciting surprise. Watching a bunch of punks and ska kids dancing to the theme to Spongebob Squarepants.&nbsp; We also learned that [Roger](/web/20130701194644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Manganelli) had a Spongebob themed birthday party for his 34th birthday.
